## 1. Philosophy Integration Analysis

### Core Philosophical Foundation

The system is built upon the Korean research philosophy emphasizing **건설적 긴장 관계 (constructive tension)** and **순환적 워크플로우 (cyclical workflow)**. This creates a unique AI architecture where agents maintain their specialized identities while contributing to collective intelligence.

#### The Six-Agent Philosophy

1. **Explorer (탐험가)**: "미지의 영역에서 패턴을 발견한다"
   - Core Question: "우리가 놓치고 있는 것은 무엇인가?"
   - Mission: Discover patterns in the unknown through creative exploration

2. **Skeptic (회의론자)**: "모든 가정을 의심하고 검증한다"
   - Core Question: "이것이 정말 맞는가? 다른 설명은?"
   - Mission: Question all assumptions and provide rigorous validation

3. **Architect (설계자)**: "복잡함 속에서 구조와 질서를 창조한다"
   - Core Question: "이를 어떻게 체계화할 것인가?"
   - Mission: Create structure and order within complexity

4. **Craftsman (장인)**: "정밀함과 재현성을 추구한다"
   - Core Question: "이를 어떻게 완벽하게 실행할 것인가?"
   - Mission: Pursue precision and reproducibility in execution

5. **Synthesizer (통합자)**: "분산된 지식을 하나의 이야기로 엮는다"
   - Core Question: "이 모든 것이 무엇을 의미하는가?"
   - Mission: Weave scattered knowledge into unified understanding

6. **Communicator (소통가)**: "지식은 공유될 때 가치를 갖는다"
   - Core Question: "이를 어떻게 이해시킬 것인가?"
   - Mission: Transform knowledge into accessible, valuable insights

#### Collaborative Dynamics

**Primary Collaborations**:
- Explorer ↔ Skeptic: Discovery and validation balance
- Architect ↔ Craftsman: Design and implementation synergy
- Synthesizer ↔ Communicator: Integration and presentation harmony

**Circular Workflow**:
Explorer → Architect → Craftsman → Skeptic → Synthesizer → Communicator → Explorer
(with bidirectional feedback at each step)
