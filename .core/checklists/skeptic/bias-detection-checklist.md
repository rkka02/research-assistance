# Bias Detection Checklist

**Purpose**: Systematic identification and evaluation of biases that could affect physics research validity and reliability

**Korean Philosophy**: "편견을 인식하는 것이 객관성의 시작이다" (Recognizing bias is the beginning of objectivity)

## Cognitive Bias Assessment

### Confirmation Bias Detection
- [ ] **Selective evidence** emphasis identified and evaluated
- [ ] **Contradictory evidence** given appropriate consideration
- [ ] **Hypothesis modification** willingness demonstrated when warranted
- [ ] **Disconfirming tests** included in research design
- [ ] **Alternative explanations** systematically considered
- [ ] **Cherry-picking** evidence patterns identified and addressed
- [ ] **Post-hoc rationalization** distinguished from a priori reasoning

### Anchoring and Adjustment Bias
- [ ] **Initial estimates** influence on final conclusions assessed
- [ ] **Reference point** dependence evaluated
- [ ] **Insufficient adjustment** from starting values identified
- [ ] **Historical precedent** inappropriate influence assessed
- [ ] **Authority figure** influence on reasoning evaluated
- [ ] **First impression** persistence beyond evidence examined
- [ ] **Numerical anchoring** effects in quantitative estimates assessed

### Availability Heuristic Bias
- [ ] **Recent events** undue influence on probability assessment
- [ ] **Memorable cases** disproportionate weight in reasoning
- [ ] **Media coverage** influence on research priorities assessed
- [ ] **Personal experience** inappropriate generalization identified
- [ ] **Vivid examples** over-influence on general conclusions
- [ ] **Publication visibility** bias in literature consideration
- [ ] **Conference presentation** recency effects evaluated

## Bias Mitigation Strategies

### Implemented Mitigation Measures
- [ ] **Blinding procedures** implemented where possible
- [ ] **Independent validation** sought from external sources
- [ ] **Diverse perspectives** included in research team
- [ ] **Pre-registration** of hypotheses and analysis plans
- [ ] **Systematic review** protocols followed
- [ ] **Meta-analysis** techniques used where appropriate
- [ ] **Sensitivity analyses** performed to test robustness

### Additional Mitigation Recommendations
- [ ] **Bias training** recommended for research team
- [ ] **External advisory** input suggested
- [ ] **Adversarial collaboration** considered
- [ ] **Replication studies** encouraged and facilitated
- [ ] **Open science** practices promoted
- [ ] **Transparency measures** enhanced
- [ ] **Community validation** sought through broader review

**Bias Detection Certification**

- [ ] **All bias categories** systematically evaluated
- [ ] **Significant biases** identified and assessed for impact
- [ ] **Mitigation strategies** implemented or recommended
- [ ] **Residual bias** risks clearly communicated
- [ ] **Overall bias impact** on conclusions evaluated
