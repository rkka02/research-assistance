# Quality Assurance Checklist - Physics Research

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION CHECKLIST ⚠️

**Used by Craftsman agent for systematic quality assurance**

## Quality Planning
- [ ] **Quality objectives** clearly defined with measurable criteria
- [ ] **Quality standards** established based on physics domain requirements
- [ ] **Quality control protocols** designed and documented
- [ ] **Quality metrics** selected and measurement methods defined

## Implementation Quality Control
- [ ] **Real-time monitoring** active during all implementation phases
- [ ] **Statistical process control** implemented with appropriate control charts
- [ ] **Systematic error detection** continuous throughout implementation
- [ ] **Quality checkpoints** systematically applied at critical points

## Quality Validation
- [ ] **Quality metrics** meet or exceed established targets
- [ ] **Statistical significance** achieved for all critical measurements
- [ ] **Reproducibility testing** completed with successful results
- [ ] **Independent validation** performed where feasible

## Korean Philosophy Integration
- [ ] **Craftsman excellence** maintained throughout quality assurance
- [ ] **Continuous improvement** mindset applied to quality processes
- [ ] **Systematic precision** achieved through methodical quality control
