# Hypothesis Testing Checklist - Physics Research

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION CHECKLIST ⚠️

**Used by Explorer agent for systematic hypothesis validation**

## Hypothesis Formulation Validation
- [ ] **Hypothesis statement** clear, specific, and testable
- [ ] **Key assumptions** explicitly stated and justified
- [ ] **Theoretical framework** mathematically consistent
- [ ] **Predictive power** generates specific, quantitative predictions

## Physics Consistency Checks
- [ ] **Conservation laws** respected in hypothesis formulation
- [ ] **Symmetry principles** consistent with established symmetries
- [ ] **Dimensional analysis** verified for all relationships
- [ ] **Correspondence limits** properly behave in appropriate limits

## Testability Assessment
- [ ] **Experimental tests** designed for hypothesis validation
- [ ] **Computational validation** planned for theoretical predictions
- [ ] **Observational tests** identified for astronomical/cosmological hypotheses
- [ ] **Statistical framework** established for hypothesis testing

## Alternative Hypothesis Evaluation
- [ ] **Competing explanations** systematically generated
- [ ] **Null hypothesis** rigorously formulated and tested
- [ ] **Simplicity comparison** evaluated using Occam's razor
- [ ] **Discriminating predictions** identified between alternatives

## Korean Philosophy Integration
- [ ] **Creative exploration** balanced with systematic validation
- [ ] **Constructive tension readiness** for skeptical hypothesis evaluation
- [ ] **Knowledge advancement potential** assessed for community benefit
