## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE TASK - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

Apply systematic knowledge gap analysis methodology to identify missing knowledge, unexplored research areas, and opportunities for scientific advancement in physics research.

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Knowledge gaps reveal research frontiers - systematic identification accelerates strategic discovery and breakthrough opportunities.

## Method Description

**Physics Knowledge Gap Analysis System (PKGAS)**: Comprehensive gap analysis framework combining literature coverage analysis, theoretical completeness assessment, experimental validation gap identification, and cross-domain integration opportunity mapping.

**Key Innovation**: Orchestrates multiple gap identification methods while prioritizing gaps by discovery potential and feasibility for systematic research frontier identification.

## Knowledge Gap Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Knowledge Landscape Mapping
1. **Web Search Coverage**: Research current knowledge state across physics domains and emerging trends
2. **Literature Coverage Analysis**: Map research publication density and identify under-explored topics
3. **Theoretical Framework Assessment**: Evaluate completeness of theoretical coverage and identify conceptual gaps
4. **Experimental Validation Status**: Assess experimental confirmation status of theoretical predictions
5. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Identify integration opportunities and connection gaps between physics domains

### Phase 2: Systematic Gap Identification

**Step 1: Literature Coverage Gap Analysis**
- Map physics topic space with comprehensive domain coverage
- Analyze publication density across all identified topics
- Assess author and institutional diversity in research areas
- Evaluate citation impact and research influence patterns
- Identify systematically under-researched areas and topics

**Step 2: Theoretical Completeness Assessment**
- Evaluate theoretical framework completeness for each physics domain
- Identify mathematical gaps and missing theoretical developments
- Assess predictive capability gaps in existing theories
- Map theoretical inconsistencies and unresolved paradoxes
- Identify theoretical-experimental integration gaps

**Step 3: Experimental Validation Gap Analysis**
- Map experimental validation status for theoretical predictions
- Identify theories lacking experimental confirmation
- Assess experimental capability gaps for testing theoretical predictions
- Evaluate measurement precision gaps relative to theoretical requirements
- Identify systematic experimental bias and validation gaps

**Step 4: Cross-Domain Integration Gap Assessment**
- Map connections between different physics domains
- Identify missing interdisciplinary research opportunities
- Assess methodological transfer gaps between domains
- Evaluate collaboration gaps in multi-disciplinary research
- Identify knowledge translation gaps between theory and application

### Phase 3: Gap Prioritization and Strategic Planning

**Step 1: Gap Significance Assessment**
- Evaluate discovery potential for each identified knowledge gap
- Assess feasibility and resource requirements for gap investigation
- Analyze strategic importance for physics advancement
- Evaluate community interest and collaboration potential
- Assess timeline and milestone requirements for gap research

**Step 2: Research Opportunity Identification**
- Transform identified gaps into specific research opportunities
- Design investigation strategies for high-priority gaps
- Identify required resources and expertise for gap research
- Map potential collaborations and partnerships for gap investigation
- Create research proposal frameworks for gap-focused projects

## Interactive Flow

*Wait for user response, then systematically map knowledge landscape*

### Step 2: Comprehensive Gap Analysis
**Action**: Execute systematic knowledge gap identification
- Map current knowledge state across the specified domain
- Analyze literature coverage patterns and identify under-researched areas
- Assess theoretical completeness and identify conceptual gaps
- Evaluate experimental validation status and identify testing gaps
- Map cross-domain integration opportunities and collaboration gaps

### Step 3: Gap Prioritization and Strategy
**Action**: Prioritize gaps and develop investigation strategies
- Assess discovery potential and feasibility for all identified gaps
- Prioritize gaps based on significance, feasibility, and strategic importance
- Transform high-priority gaps into specific research opportunities
- Design investigation approaches and resource requirements
- Create collaboration frameworks for gap-focused research

### Step 4: Research Opportunity Development
**Action**: Develop actionable research opportunities from identified gaps
- Create detailed research opportunity descriptions and objectives
- Design investigation methodologies and validation approaches
- Plan resource allocation and timeline for gap research
- Identify collaboration partners and expertise requirements
- Prepare research proposal frameworks and funding strategies
