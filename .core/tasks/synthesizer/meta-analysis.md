# meta-analysis

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE TASK - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

Apply systematic meta-analysis methodology to combine and synthesize results from multiple physics studies for comprehensive understanding and evidence-based conclusions.

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Meta-analysis enables evidence synthesis - systematic integration of multiple studies accelerates reliable conclusions through comprehensive statistical and qualitative synthesis.

## Method Description

**Physics Meta-Analysis System (PMAS)**: Comprehensive meta-analysis framework combining systematic review, statistical synthesis, quality assessment, and bias detection for rigorous physics research integration.

**Key Innovation**: Integrates multiple meta-analysis methodologies while maintaining statistical rigor and enabling systematic quality assurance across experimental, theoretical, and computational physics studies.

## Meta-Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Systematic Review and Study Selection
1. **Web Search Strategy**: Develop comprehensive search strategy for physics literature identification
2. **Study Selection Criteria**: Establish systematic inclusion and exclusion criteria for meta-analysis
3. **Literature Search Execution**: Execute comprehensive literature search across multiple databases
4. **Study Quality Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of study quality and validity
5. **Data Extraction Protocol**: Standardized data extraction procedures for systematic synthesis

### Phase 2: Statistical Meta-Analysis Implementation

**Step 1: Effect Size Calculation and Standardization**
- Calculate appropriate effect sizes for each study using standardized methods
- Convert different measurement scales and units to common effect size metrics
- Assess effect size precision and uncertainty through systematic analysis
- Validate effect size calculations through independent verification
- Document effect size methodology and systematic quality assessment

**Step 2: Heterogeneity Assessment and Management**
- Evaluate between-study heterogeneity using appropriate statistical tests
- Assess sources of heterogeneity through systematic subgroup analysis
- Implement random effects or mixed effects models as appropriate
- Conduct meta-regression analysis for continuous moderator evaluation
- Document heterogeneity analysis and systematic management strategies

**Step 3: Statistical Synthesis and Integration**
- Apply appropriate meta-analysis statistical methods for result combination
- Calculate combined effect sizes with appropriate confidence intervals
- Implement sensitivity analysis for robustness assessment
- Conduct influence analysis for individual study impact evaluation
- Validate statistical synthesis through systematic quality control

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment and Bias Control

**Step 1: Publication Bias Detection and Assessment**
- Create funnel plots for visual publication bias assessment
- Apply statistical tests for publication bias detection
- Implement publication bias correction methods as appropriate
- Assess gray literature and unpublished study impact
- Document publication bias analysis and correction procedures

**Step 2: Study Quality Integration**
- Weight studies by quality scores or conduct quality-stratified analysis
- Assess impact of study quality on meta-analysis conclusions
- Implement quality-based sensitivity analysis
- Document study quality integration methodology
- Validate quality assessment impact on synthesis conclusions

## Interactive Flow

### Step 1: Meta-Analysis Scope and Protocol Definition
**Question**: "What physics research question requires meta-analysis and what are the specific study inclusion criteria and synthesis objectives?"

*Wait for user response, then systematically develop meta-analysis protocol*

### Step 2: Systematic Literature Review and Study Selection
**Action**: Execute comprehensive literature review and study selection
- Develop systematic search strategy and execute comprehensive literature search
- Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria systematically across identified studies
- Assess study quality using appropriate quality assessment tools
- Extract data systematically using standardized data extraction procedures
- Document literature review process for reproducibility and transparency

### Step 3: Statistical Meta-Analysis Execution
**Action**: Implement systematic statistical synthesis and integration
- Calculate appropriate effect sizes with systematic uncertainty assessment
- Evaluate heterogeneity and implement appropriate statistical models
- Conduct comprehensive statistical synthesis with sensitivity analysis
- Assess publication bias and implement bias correction procedures
- Validate statistical meta-analysis through systematic quality control

### Step 4: Meta-Analysis Quality Assurance and Interpretation
**Action**: Ensure meta-analysis quality and develop evidence-based conclusions
- Validate meta-analysis completeness and systematic quality
- Interpret meta-analysis results with appropriate confidence and uncertainty
- Assess implications for physics research and future investigation directions
- Document meta-analysis process and results for reproducibility
- Prepare meta-analysis for critical evaluation and community review
