# Load Agent Context - 나나미 (Synthesizer) Memory System

## Purpose
Load validated insights from all agents to create unified understanding, identify cross-domain connections, and weave scattered knowledge into coherent frameworks.

## Implementation

### 1. Read Previous Agent Essential Context
```yaml
Read .core/.agent-memory/shared-knowledge/project-state.yaml
- Check collective_discoveries and accumulated_knowledge
- Understand cross_agent_patterns and synthesis opportunities

Read .core/.agent-memory/agent-workspaces/*/essential.yaml
- Load collaboration_value from all agents
- Identify critical_insights, validated_insights, breakthrough_potential
- Note implementation_value and quality_achievements
```

### 2. Load Relevant Agent Work (Integration Priority)
```yaml
Priority Loading Order:
1. Skeptic (레이) - validated insights with confidence levels for safe integration
2. Explorer (히카리) - discovered patterns and anomalies requiring unified explanation
3. Architect (아카네) - structural frameworks needing theoretical integration
4. Craftsman (츠구미) - implemented tools and empirical results for synthesis
5. Communicator (모모카) - presentation insights and knowledge gaps for completion
```

### 3. Integration Opportunity Analysis
```yaml
Synthesis Assessment:
- Identify validated discoveries requiring unified theoretical framework
- Analyze structural patterns across different domains and scales
- Evaluate empirical results needing theoretical integration
- Map cross-domain connections and emergent relationships
- Plan meta-analysis of accumulated evidence and insights
```

### 4. Knowledge Categorization for Integration
```yaml
Integration Targets:
  validated_discoveries:
    source: "Skeptic-validated insights with high confidence"
    integration_approach: "Core foundation for unified framework"
    priority: "Critical - reliable knowledge base"
    
  structural_patterns:
    source: "Architect designs and Explorer patterns"
    integration_approach: "Systematic framework unification"
    priority: "High - organizational coherence"
    
  empirical_results:
    source: "Craftsman implementations and measurements"
    integration_approach: "Evidence-based synthesis validation"
    priority: "High - practical grounding"
    
  theoretical_connections:
    source: "Cross-agent insights and relationships"
    integration_approach: "Conceptual bridging and unification"
    priority: "Medium - theoretical coherence"
    
  emergent_insights:
    source: "Unexpected connections between agent findings"
    integration_approach: "Novel synthesis and breakthrough identification"
    priority: "Medium - innovation potential"
```

### 5. Cross-Domain Connection Mapping
```yaml
Connection Analysis:
  agent_complementarity:
    explorer_architect: "Discovery patterns → structural frameworks"
    architect_craftsman: "Design specifications → implementations"
    craftsman_skeptic: "Implementations → validation results"
    skeptic_synthesizer: "Validated insights → unified understanding"
    synthesizer_communicator: "Integrated knowledge → accessible presentation"
    
  scale_bridging:
    micro_macro: "Local patterns → global phenomena"
    theoretical_empirical: "Abstract frameworks → concrete implementations"
    qualitative_quantitative: "Pattern insights → measurement results"
    
  domain_bridging:
    physics_domains: "Theoretical ↔ Experimental ↔ Computational"
    methodology_bridges: "Discovery ↔ Design ↔ Implementation ↔ Validation"
    knowledge_types: "Patterns ↔ Structures ↔ Tools ↔ Evidence"
```

### 6. Meta-Analysis Preparation
```yaml
Meta-Analysis Planning:
  evidence_integration:
    empirical_convergence: "Where do measurements and implementations agree?"
    theoretical_consistency: "How do frameworks align across domains?"
    pattern_coherence: "What universal patterns emerge across findings?"
    
  uncertainty_synthesis:
    confidence_weighting: "Weight insights by Skeptic confidence levels"
    uncertainty_propagation: "How uncertainties combine in integration"
    robustness_assessment: "Which integrated insights are most robust?"
    
  emergence_detection:
    novel_connections: "Unexpected relationships between agent findings"
    emergent_properties: "Insights arising from collective understanding"
    breakthrough_potential: "Revolutionary implications of unified knowledge"
```

### 7. Output Format

## Usage
- Execute automatically during agent activation
- Present synthesis opportunities based on validated insights
- Focus integration efforts on highest-confidence knowledge
- Weave scattered knowledge into unified understanding

## Integration Philosophy
Apply 통합적 지혜 (integrative wisdom):
- Honor the unique contributions of each agent
- Seek deep connections beyond surface similarities
- Create coherent narratives from diverse findings
- Build bridges between abstract theory and concrete practice
- Enable emergence of insights greater than the sum of parts
