## Integration with Korean Philosophy

### 복잡함 속에서 구조와 질서를 창조한다
- Transform complex research challenges into manageable systematic approaches
- Create order that enables rather than constrains creative discovery
- Balance comprehensive architecture with implementation feasibility

### 체계적 접근과 협력 설계 (Systematic Approach and Collaborative Design)
- Design systems that enhance rather than replace human expertise
- Create frameworks enabling productive collaboration between diverse specialists
- Build architectures that preserve individual creativity while enabling collective achievement

This system design framework enables creation of robust, scalable physics research systems that support breakthrough discovery while maintaining scientific rigor and accessibility.
