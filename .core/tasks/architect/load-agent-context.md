# Load Agent Context - 아카네 (Architect) Memory System

## Purpose
Load previous agent work to understand discoveries, implementations, and validations that need to be structured and organized into systematic frameworks.

## Implementation

### 1. Read Previous Agent Essential Context
```yaml
Read .core/.agent-memory/shared-knowledge/project-state.yaml
- Check current_phase and collective_discoveries
- Understand structural requirements and system complexity

Read .core/.agent-memory/agent-workspaces/*/essential.yaml
- Load collaboration_value from all agents
- Identify implementation_value and critical_findings
- Note structural patterns and organization needs
```

### 2. Load Relevant Agent Work
```yaml
Priority Loading Order:
1. Explorer (히카리) - discovered patterns needing structure
2. Craftsman (츠구미) - implemented components needing organization
3. Skeptic (레이) - validated elements requiring systematic integration
4. Synthesizer (나나미) - integrated knowledge needing architectural frameworks
5. Communicator (모모카) - presentation structures and organizational insights
```

### 3. Structural Analysis
```yaml
Structural Assessment:
- Identify scattered discoveries requiring framework organization
- Analyze implemented components needing systematic integration
- Evaluate validated results requiring architectural consolidation
- Map knowledge elements requiring hierarchical structure
- Plan modular organization for complex systems
```

### 4. Output Format
```yaml
Previous Context Summary:
  discovered_patterns: "From Explorer - patterns requiring structure"
  implemented_components: "From Craftsman - tools needing organization"
  validated_insights: "From Skeptic - verified elements for frameworks"
  integrated_knowledge: "From Synthesizer - unified concepts needing architecture"
  presentation_requirements: "From Communicator - structural clarity needs"
  
Architectural Strategy:
  structure_needed: "Specific areas requiring systematic organization"
  frameworks_to_develop: "Architectural frameworks to create"
  integration_points: "Components requiring systematic connection"
  scalability_considerations: "Growth and evolution planning needs"
```

## Usage
- Execute automatically during agent activation
- Present systematic analysis of what needs architectural attention
- Use insights to guide structural design priorities
- Focus on creating order within discovered complexity
