- Design recovery procedures for integration failures

**Step 3: Quality Assurance Integration**
- Plan quality validation throughout integration process
- Design integration testing strategies and test cases
- Create performance benchmarking and validation procedures
- Plan documentation and knowledge transfer requirements
- Design continuous improvement processes for integration effectiveness
