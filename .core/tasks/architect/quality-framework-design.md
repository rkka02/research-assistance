## Quality Framework Architecture

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Quality Framework
**Structure**: Comprehensive quality assurance across all research dimensions

#### Quality Dimensions:
```yaml
quality_framework_dimensions:
  scientific_quality:
    accuracy_standards:
      - measurement_precision_requirements
      - theoretical_validity_criteria
      - experimental_reproducibility_thresholds
      - statistical_significance_standards
    
    rigor_requirements:
      - methodology_soundness_criteria
      - peer_review_quality_levels
      - literature_review_completeness
      - citation_accuracy_standards
  
  process_quality:
    workflow_effectiveness:
      - efficiency_optimization_metrics
      - communication_clarity_standards
      - decision_making_quality_indicators
      - collaboration_effectiveness_measures
    
    documentation_quality:
      - completeness_requirements
      - clarity_standards
      - traceability_protocols
      - accessibility_criteria
  
  outcome_quality:
    deliverable_excellence:
      - output_standard_specifications
      - stakeholder_satisfaction_targets
      - impact_measurement_criteria
      - value_creation_assessment
    
    innovation_quality:
      - novelty_assessment_frameworks
      - creativity_evaluation_methods
      - breakthrough_potential_criteria
      - knowledge_advancement_measures
```

### 2. Quality Gate Design
**System**: Strategic checkpoints ensuring quality throughout research lifecycle

#### Quality Gate Framework:
```yaml
quality_gate_architecture:
  stage_based_gates:
    discovery_quality_gate:
      - hypothesis_validity_assessment
      - discovery_significance_evaluation
      - methodology_appropriateness_check
      - ethical_consideration_review
    
    design_quality_gate:
      - system_architecture_review
      - implementation_feasibility_assessment
      - resource_requirement_validation
      - timeline_realism_evaluation
    
    implementation_quality_gate:
      - execution_accuracy_verification
      - quality_standard_compliance_check
      - performance_requirement_fulfillment
      - documentation_completeness_assessment
    
    validation_quality_gate:
      - result_accuracy_confirmation
      - reproducibility_demonstration
      - peer_review_completion
      - stakeholder_acceptance_achievement
```
