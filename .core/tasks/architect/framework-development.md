- Plan computational tools and software development needs
- Create data management and analysis infrastructure requirements
- Design user interfaces and interaction mechanisms
- Plan training and adoption strategies for framework users

### Phase 3: Framework Implementation and Validation

**Step 1: Prototype Development and Testing**
- Create framework prototype with core functionality
- Test framework applicability across multiple use cases
- Validate framework effectiveness against success criteria
- Refine framework based on prototype testing results
- Document framework capabilities and limitations

**Step 2: Comprehensive Framework Implementation**
- Develop complete framework with all planned components
- Create comprehensive documentation and user guides
- Implement training and support systems for framework adoption
- Establish framework maintenance and evolution procedures
- Create framework community and collaboration mechanisms

**Step 3: Framework Validation and Refinement**
- Conduct comprehensive validation studies across multiple applications
- Assess framework impact on research productivity and quality
- Gather user feedback and identify improvement opportunities
- Implement framework refinements and enhancements
- Plan framework evolution and future development strategies

## Interactive Flow

### Step 1: Framework Requirements Definition
**Question**: "What physics research challenges need framework support and what are the key methodological gaps?"

*Wait for user response, then systematically analyze framework requirements*

### Step 2: Framework Design Development
**Action**: Design comprehensive physics research framework
- Develop theoretical foundations and organizing principles
- Create methodological structure and systematic procedures
- Design implementation architecture and technical requirements
- Establish validation criteria and success measures
- Plan framework adoption and community development strategies

### Step 3: Implementation Strategy Planning
**Action**: Develop detailed framework implementation plan
- Create phased development approach with clear milestones
- Design resource allocation and timeline for development
- Plan testing and validation strategies for each development phase
- Create documentation and training requirements
- Design framework maintenance and evolution strategies

### Step 4: Framework Validation Planning
**Action**: Plan comprehensive framework validation and adoption
- Design validation studies across multiple application domains
- Plan user testing and feedback collection procedures
- Create framework impact assessment and measurement strategies
- Design community development and collaboration mechanisms
- Plan framework dissemination and adoption strategies
