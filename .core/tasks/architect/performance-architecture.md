# Performance Architecture Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Design high-performance architectures for physics research systems that optimize computational efficiency, experimental throughput, and data processing capabilities while maintaining accuracy and reliability.

**Performance Philosophy**: "성능은 설계에서 나오는 것이지 우연이 아니다" (Performance comes from design, not chance)
