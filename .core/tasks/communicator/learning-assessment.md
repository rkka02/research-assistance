# Learning Assessment Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Design and implement comprehensive assessment systems that accurately measure physics learning, provide actionable feedback, and support continuous improvement in understanding.

**Assessment Philosophy**: "평가는 학습을 위한 것이지, 학습에 대한 것이 아니다" (Assessment is for learning, not of learning)
