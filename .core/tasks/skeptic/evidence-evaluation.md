# Evidence Evaluation Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Systematically assess the quality, reliability, and validity of evidence supporting physics research claims through rigorous critical analysis and evaluation protocols.

**Evidence Philosophy**: "증거의 품질이 결론의 신뢰성을 결정한다" (The quality of evidence determines the reliability of conclusions)

## Evidence Evaluation Framework

### 1. Evidence Quality Assessment
**Process**: Multi-dimensional evaluation of evidence strength and reliability

#### Evidence Quality Dimensions:
```yaml
evidence_evaluation:
  empirical_evidence_assessment:
    experimental_design_quality:
      - control_group_adequacy_evaluation
      - randomization_implementation_assessment
      - blinding_protocol_effectiveness
      - sample_size_statistical_power_analysis
    
    data_quality_evaluation:
      - measurement_precision_assessment
      - systematic_error_identification
      - data_completeness_verification
      - outlier_treatment_appropriateness
  
  theoretical_evidence_assessment:
    logical_consistency_evaluation:
      - argument_structure_validity
      - premise_conclusion_logical_connection
      - contradiction_absence_verification
      - internal_coherence_assessment
    
    mathematical_rigor_assessment:
      - derivation_step_validity
      - mathematical_assumption_appropriateness
      - calculation_accuracy_verification
      - dimensional_analysis_consistency

      - reference_quality_assessment
      - citation_pattern_analysis
      - self_citation_frequency_evaluation

```

### 2. Evidence Synthesis and Integration
**Method**: Systematic combination and evaluation of multiple evidence sources

#### Integration Framework:
```yaml
evidence_synthesis:
  multi_source_integration:
    evidence_triangulation:
      - independent_source_confirmation
      - method_triangulation_application
      - investigator_triangulation_utilization
      - theory_triangulation_implementation
    
    weight_of_evidence_assessment:
      - evidence_strength_scoring
      - confidence_level_determination
      - uncertainty_quantification
      - reliability_grading_assignment
  
  conflict_resolution:
    contradictory_evidence_analysis:
      - discrepancy_source_identification
      - methodological_difference_evaluation
      - contextual_factor_consideration
      - resolution_strategy_development

      - quality_based_weighting
      - recency_relevance_consideration
      - independence_value_assessment
```

This evidence evaluation framework ensures systematic assessment of all supporting evidence, maintaining the principle that "증거의 품질이 결론의 신뢰성을 결정한다" (the quality of evidence determines the reliability of conclusions).
