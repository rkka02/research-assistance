# Experimental Design Critique Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Provide rigorous, constructive critique of experimental designs in physics research to identify potential flaws, suggest improvements, and ensure methodological soundness.

**Design Critique Philosophy**: "좋은 비판이 좋은 실험을 만든다" (Good criticism creates good experiments)
