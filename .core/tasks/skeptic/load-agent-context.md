# Load Agent Context - 레이 (Skeptic) Memory System

## Purpose
Load previous agent work to identify claims, discoveries, implementations, and assertions that require rigorous validation and critical analysis.

## Implementation

### 1. Read Previous Agent Essential Context
```yaml
Read .core/.agent-memory/shared-knowledge/project-state.yaml
- Check current_phase and collective_discoveries for validation targets
- Understand confidence levels and validation requirements

Read .core/.agent-memory/agent-workspaces/*/essential.yaml
- Load critical_findings, breakthrough_potential, implementation_value
- Identify collaboration_value claims requiring verification
- Note quality_achievements and confidence assertions
```

### 2. Load Relevant Agent Work (Priority Order)
```yaml
Priority Loading Order:
1. Craftsman (츠구미) - implementations requiring accuracy validation
2. Explorer (히카리) - discoveries needing statistical significance testing
3. Architect (아카네) - design assumptions requiring logical consistency check
4. Synthesizer (나나미) - integrated conclusions needing cross-validation
5. Communicator (모모카) - presentation claims requiring fact-checking
```

### 3. Critical Analysis Planning
```yaml
Validation Assessment:
- Identify statistical claims requiring significance testing
- Analyze implementation accuracy and reproducibility claims
- Evaluate design assumptions and logical consistency
- Map methodological choices and their justifications
- Plan bias detection and alternative hypothesis testing
```

### 4. Claims Categorization
```yaml
Validation Targets:
  high_confidence_claims:
    source: "Claims with strong confidence assertions"
    validation_approach: "Comprehensive multi-method validation"
    priority: "Medium - verify robustness"
    
  medium_confidence_claims:
    source: "Claims with moderate confidence"
    validation_approach: "Statistical significance testing"
    priority: "High - require stronger validation"
    
  breakthrough_claims:
    source: "Claims of breakthrough discoveries"
    validation_approach: "Independent replication + peer review"
    priority: "Critical - extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"
    
  implementation_claims:
    source: "Quality and performance assertions"
    validation_approach: "Reproducibility testing + benchmarking"
    priority: "High - practical verification needed"
    
  design_assumptions:
    source: "Architectural and methodological assumptions"
    validation_approach: "Logical consistency + alternative testing"
    priority: "Medium - foundational validity check"
```

### 5. Bias Detection Preparation
```yaml
Bias Analysis Planning:
  confirmation_bias:
    indicators: "Cherry-picked results, ignored contrary evidence"
    sources: "Explorer discoveries, Synthesizer conclusions"
    
  survivorship_bias:
    indicators: "Focus on successful cases only"
    sources: "Implementation success stories, design validations"
    
  publication_bias:
    indicators: "Over-reliance on published positive results"
    sources: "Literature-based claims, research citations"
    
  methodology_bias:
    indicators: "Preference for familiar methods"
    sources: "Technical implementation choices, analysis approaches"
```

### 6. Output Format
```yaml
Previous Context Summary:
  discoveries_to_validate: "From Explorer - patterns and anomalies requiring verification"
  implementations_to_test: "From Craftsman - code and tools requiring accuracy testing"
  designs_to_critique: "From Architect - frameworks requiring logical analysis"
  integrations_to_verify: "From Synthesizer - unified conclusions requiring cross-check"
  claims_to_fact_check: "From Communicator - presentation assertions requiring validation"
  
Validation Strategy:
  priority_validations: "Highest risk claims requiring immediate validation"
  statistical_tests_needed: "Specific statistical methods to apply"
  reproducibility_checks: "Implementation and experimental replication targets"
  bias_detection_plan: "Systematic bias analysis approach"
  alternative_hypotheses: "Counter-explanations to test and explore"
  
Critical Questions:
  assumption_challenges: "What assumptions need questioning?"
  evidence_gaps: "What evidence is missing or insufficient?"
  methodology_concerns: "What methodological issues need addressing?"
  confidence_justifications: "Are confidence levels appropriately justified?"
```

## Usage
- Execute automatically during agent activation
- Present critical analysis priorities based on previous claims
- Focus validation efforts on highest-risk assertions
- Maintain systematic doubt while enabling constructive progress

## Validation Philosophy
Apply 건설적 회의 (constructive doubt):
- Question everything systematically, not destructively
- Strengthen research through rigorous validation
- Build confidence through independent verification
- Enable breakthrough discoveries through careful validation
