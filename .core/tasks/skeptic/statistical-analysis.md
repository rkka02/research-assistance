### Phase 3: Statistical Quality Assurance and Validation

**Step 1: Uncertainty Quantification and Propagation**
- Calculate comprehensive uncertainty budgets with Type A and Type B components
- Implement uncertainty propagation through statistical analysis procedures
- Evaluate systematic bias impact on statistical conclusions
- Assess measurement uncertainty contribution to statistical inference
- Validate uncertainty assessment through independent verification

**Step 2: Statistical Quality Control Implementation**
- Monitor statistical analysis quality through systematic quality control procedures
