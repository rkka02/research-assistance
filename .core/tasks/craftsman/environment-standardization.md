# Environment Standardization Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Establish and maintain standardized computing and experimental environments that ensure reproducible physics research implementations across different platforms and conditions.

**Standardization Philosophy**: "일관된 환경이 일관된 결과를 보장한다" (Consistent environment guarantees consistent results)

## Environment Standardization Framework

### 1. Computational Environment Standardization
**System**: Reproducible computing environments for physics simulations and analysis

#### Environment Control Protocol:
```yaml
computational_standardization:
  software_environment:
    - operating_system_specification
    - software_version_pinning
    - dependency_management_systems
    - container_based_deployment
    
  hardware_standardization:
    - computational_resource_specification
    - performance_benchmark_establishment
    - hardware_compatibility_testing
    - scalability_requirement_definition
```

### 2. Experimental Environment Control
**Focus**: Standardized experimental conditions and procedures

#### Experimental Standardization:
```yaml
experimental_standardization:
  laboratory_conditions:
    - temperature_humidity_control
    - vibration_isolation_standards
    - electromagnetic_interference_shielding
    - cleanliness_protocol_implementation
    
  equipment_standardization:
    - calibration_procedure_standardization
    - maintenance_schedule_establishment
    - usage_protocol_documentation
    - quality_assurance_integration
```
