## Monitoring Framework

### 1. Real-Time Performance Monitoring
**System**: Continuous tracking of computational and experimental performance metrics

#### Monitoring Protocol:
```yaml
performance_monitoring:
  computational_monitoring:
    - cpu_memory_usage_tracking
    - processing_speed_measurement
    - error_rate_monitoring
    - system_stability_assessment
    
  experimental_monitoring:
    - measurement_precision_tracking
    - instrument_performance_monitoring
    - environmental_condition_surveillance
    - data_quality_real_time_assessment
```

### 2. Quality Assurance Monitoring
**Focus**: Continuous quality tracking and early warning systems

#### Quality Monitoring:
```yaml
quality_monitoring:
  accuracy_tracking:
    - measurement_deviation_monitoring
    - systematic_error_detection
    - calibration_drift_surveillance
    - reference_standard_comparison
    
  reliability_assessment:
    - reproducibility_metric_tracking
    - temporal_stability_monitoring
    - operator_consistency_measurement
    - environmental_robustness_evaluation
```
