# Version Control Management Task Framework

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Implement systematic version control practices that ensure traceability, collaboration, and quality management in physics research implementations.

**Version Control Philosophy**: "변화를 추적하면 진보를 이해한다" (Tracking changes leads to understanding progress)

## Version Control Framework

### 1. Research Asset Management
**System**: Comprehensive tracking of all research artifacts and implementations

#### Asset Control Protocol:
```yaml
research_asset_control:
  code_version_management:
    - git_repository_organization
    - branch_strategy_implementation
    - commit_message_standardization
    - code_review_process_integration
    
  data_versioning:
    - dataset_version_tracking
    - analysis_pipeline_versioning
    - result_reproduction_capability
    - data_lineage_documentation
    
  document_version_control:
    - research_paper_draft_tracking
    - methodology_evolution_documentation
    - protocol_modification_history
    - knowledge_artifact_versioning
```

### 2. Collaborative Development
**Focus**: Team-based development with quality assurance

#### Collaboration Framework:
```yaml
collaborative_development:
  team_workflow:
    - feature_branch_development
    - peer_review_requirements
    - integration_testing_protocols
    - release_management_procedures
    
  quality_gates:
    - automated_testing_integration
    - code_quality_standards
    - documentation_completeness_checks
    - physics_accuracy_validation
```

This version control framework ensures systematic tracking and management of all research assets, maintaining the principle that "변화를 추적하면 진보를 이해한다" (tracking changes leads to understanding progress).
