# Fallacy Identifier Utility

## Overview
**Purpose**: Systematic identification and analysis of logical fallacies in physics research reasoning to ensure valid argumentation and sound conclusions

**Logical Fallacy Philosophy**: "논리적 오류를 찾아내면 진리가 더 명확해진다" (Finding logical errors makes truth clearer)
