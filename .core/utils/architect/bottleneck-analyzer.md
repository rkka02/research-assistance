# Bottleneck Analyzer Utility

## Overview
**Purpose**: Systematic identification and analysis of performance bottlenecks in physics research systems to enable targeted optimization

**Bottleneck Philosophy**: "병목을 찾아 넘어서면 전체가 빨라진다" (Find and overcome bottlenecks, and the whole system accelerates)

## Bottleneck Analysis Framework

### 1. System Performance Analysis
**Method**: Comprehensive bottleneck identification across system components

#### Analysis Methodology:
```yaml
bottleneck_analysis:
  performance_profiling:
    computational_bottlenecks:
      - cpu_utilization_analysis
      - memory_usage_profiling
      - disk_io_performance_evaluation
      - network_bandwidth_assessment
    
    workflow_bottlenecks:
      - task_completion_time_analysis
      - queue_length_monitoring
      - resource_wait_time_measurement
      - coordination_overhead_assessment
  
  constraint_identification:
    resource_constraints:
      - capacity_limitation_identification
      - skill_availability_constraints
      - equipment_access_limitations
      - budget_allocation_restrictions
    
    process_constraints:
      - approval_delay_identification
      - communication_latency_analysis
      - decision_making_speed_evaluation
      - quality_gate_duration_assessment
```

### 2. Optimization Recommendation Engine
**System**: Generate targeted recommendations for bottleneck resolution

#### Recommendation Framework:
```yaml

  immediate_improvements:
    quick_wins:
      - low_effort_high_impact_optimizations
      - resource_reallocation_opportunities
      - process_streamlining_possibilities
      - automation_integration_options
  
  strategic_enhancements:
    long_term_solutions:
      - infrastructure_upgrade_planning
      - capability_development_strategies
      - technology_adoption_roadmaps
      - organizational_improvement_initiatives
```

This bottleneck analyzer enables systematic performance optimization by identifying and resolving constraints, following the principle that "병목을 찾아 넘어서면 전체가 빨라진다" (find and overcome bottlenecks, and the whole system accelerates).
