# Optimization Planner Utility

## Overview
**Purpose**: Systematic planning and coordination of optimization initiatives across physics research systems to maximize efficiency and effectiveness

**Optimization Philosophy**: "최적화는 전체를 보는 지혜에서 나온다" (Optimization comes from wisdom that sees the whole)

## Optimization Planning Framework

### 1. Systematic Optimization Strategy
**Method**: Comprehensive approach to identifying and prioritizing optimization opportunities

#### Optimization Planning Process:
```yaml
optimization_planning:
  opportunity_identification:
    performance_analysis:
      - current_state_assessment
      - bottleneck_identification
      - efficiency_gap_analysis
      - improvement_potential_evaluation
    
    priority_assessment:
      - impact_effort_matrix_analysis
      - strategic_alignment_evaluation
      - resource_requirement_assessment
      - timeline_feasibility_consideration
  
  implementation_strategy:
    optimization_roadmap:
      - phased_improvement_planning
      - dependency_management_coordination
      - resource_allocation_optimization
      - risk_mitigation_strategy_integration
    
    success_measurement:
      - performance_metric_establishment
      - improvement_target_setting
      - monitoring_system_design
      - evaluation_framework_development
```

### 2. Cross-System Optimization Coordination
**System**: Holistic optimization across multiple research system components

#### Coordination Framework:
```yaml
cross_system_optimization:
  system_integration_optimization:
    workflow_optimization:
      - process_streamlining_opportunities
      - automation_integration_planning
      - communication_efficiency_enhancement
      - decision_making_acceleration
    
    resource_optimization:
      - capacity_utilization_improvement
      - skill_deployment_optimization
      - infrastructure_efficiency_enhancement
      - cost_effectiveness_maximization
  
  stakeholder_optimization:
    user_experience_enhancement:
      - interface_usability_improvement
      - response_time_optimization
      - accessibility_enhancement
      - satisfaction_maximization
    
    team_performance_optimization:
      - collaboration_efficiency_improvement
      - expertise_sharing_enhancement
      - motivation_optimization
      - productivity_maximization
```
