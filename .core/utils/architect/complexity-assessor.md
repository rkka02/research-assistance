# Complexity Assessor Utility

## Overview
**Purpose**: Systematic assessment of system complexity to inform architectural decisions and resource planning

**Complexity Philosophy**: "복잡성을 이해하면 단순한 해결책이 보인다" (Understanding complexity reveals simple solutions)

## Complexity Assessment Framework

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Complexity Analysis
**Method**: Systematic evaluation across multiple complexity dimensions

#### Complexity Dimensions:
```yaml
complexity_assessment:
  technical_complexity:
    computational_complexity:
      - algorithm_complexity_analysis
      - data_structure_complexity_evaluation
      - integration_complexity_assessment
      - scalability_complexity_determination
    
    system_complexity:
      - component_interaction_complexity
      - dependency_relationship_complexity
      - configuration_management_complexity
      - deployment_orchestration_complexity
  
  domain_complexity:
    physics_complexity:
      - theoretical_framework_sophistication
      - experimental_setup_intricacy
      - measurement_precision_requirements
      - validation_criteria_comprehensiveness
    
    research_complexity:
      - hypothesis_generation_sophistication
      - evidence_evaluation_complexity
      - knowledge_synthesis_requirements
      - stakeholder_communication_challenges
```

### 2. Complexity Metrics and Scoring
**System**: Quantitative complexity assessment for architectural planning

#### Assessment Methodology:
```yaml
complexity_metrics:
  quantitative_measures:
    technical_metrics:
      - cyclomatic_complexity_calculation
      - coupling_cohesion_measurement
      - dependency_depth_analysis
      - interface_complexity_evaluation
    
    organizational_metrics:
      - team_coordination_complexity
      - communication_overhead_assessment
      - decision_making_complexity
      - knowledge_transfer_difficulty
  
  qualitative_assessment:
    expert_evaluation:
      - domain_expert_complexity_rating
      - implementation_difficulty_assessment
      - maintenance_challenge_evaluation
      - evolution_flexibility_rating
```
