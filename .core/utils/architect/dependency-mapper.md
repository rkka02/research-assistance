# Dependency Mapper Utility

## Purpose
Provide systematic mapping and analysis of dependencies in physics research systems to identify relationships, potential conflicts, and optimization opportunities for architectural design.

## Dependency Mapping Process

### Step 1: Dependency Discovery and Cataloging

**For each system component:**
1. **Direct Dependency Identification**
   - Identify immediate dependencies for each component
   - Catalog technical dependencies (libraries, frameworks, services)
   - Map data dependencies and information flow requirements
   - Document human resource dependencies and expertise requirements

2. **Transitive Dependency Analysis**
   - Trace indirect dependencies through dependency chains
   - Identify hidden dependencies and implicit relationships
   - Map circular dependencies and potential conflicts
   - Analyze dependency depth and complexity metrics

### Step 2: Dependency Classification and Analysis

**Dependency Type Classification:**

**Technical Dependencies:**
- **Software Dependencies**: Libraries, frameworks, operating systems
- **Hardware Dependencies**: Computational resources, specialized equipment
- **Network Dependencies**: Communication protocols, external services
- **Data Dependencies**: Databases, file systems, external data sources

**Operational Dependencies:**
- **Human Dependencies**: Expertise requirements, operational support
- **Process Dependencies**: Workflow requirements, approval processes
- **Institutional Dependencies**: Organizational policies, resource allocation
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party services, collaborative partnerships

**Temporal Dependencies:**
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Order-dependent processing requirements
- **Concurrent Dependencies**: Parallel processing coordination requirements
- **Scheduling Dependencies**: Time-based constraints and availability
- **Lifecycle Dependencies**: Installation, upgrade, and retirement sequences

### Step 3: Dependency Risk Assessment

**Risk Analysis Framework:**

**Availability Risks (25% weight):**
- Dependency availability and reliability assessment
- Single point of failure identification
- Backup and redundancy analysis
- Disaster recovery dependency evaluation

**Compatibility Risks (25% weight):**
- Version compatibility analysis across dependencies
- Technology stack integration assessment
- Future evolution compatibility evaluation
- Cross-platform compatibility validation

**Performance Risks (25% weight):**
- Dependency performance impact analysis
- Bottleneck identification in dependency chains
- Scalability limitations from dependencies
- Resource contention and optimization opportunities

**Maintenance Risks (25% weight):**
- Dependency maintenance and support assessment
- Update and upgrade complexity evaluation
- Security vulnerability management requirements
- Long-term sustainability analysis

### Step 4: Dependency Optimization Strategies

**Optimization Approaches:**

**Dependency Reduction:**
- Identify unnecessary dependencies for elimination
- Consolidate redundant dependencies
- Replace heavy dependencies with lightweight alternatives
- Eliminate circular dependencies through architectural refactoring

**Dependency Isolation:**
- Create abstraction layers to isolate external dependencies
- Implement dependency injection for flexible configuration
- Design adapter patterns for dependency substitution
- Establish clear dependency boundaries and interfaces

**Dependency Management:**
- Implement version control and configuration management
- Create dependency update and maintenance procedures
- Establish dependency monitoring and health checking
- Design dependency rollback and recovery procedures

## Dependency Visualization and Documentation

### Dependency Graph Creation

**Graph Representation Methods:**
- **Hierarchical Dependency Trees**: Show parent-child dependency relationships
- **Network Dependency Graphs**: Display complex interdependency patterns
- **Layered Architecture Diagrams**: Organize dependencies by architectural layers
- **Timeline Dependency Charts**: Show temporal dependency relationships

**Visualization Techniques:**
- **Node-Edge Graphs**: Components as nodes, dependencies as directed edges
- **Matrix Representations**: Dependency matrices showing all component relationships
- **Cluster Diagrams**: Group related dependencies for analysis
- **Critical Path Highlighting**: Emphasize critical dependency chains

### Dependency Documentation Standards

**Documentation Components:**
- **Dependency Inventory**: Complete catalog of all identified dependencies
- **Relationship Mapping**: Detailed description of dependency relationships
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Specific improvement opportunities and implementation plans
