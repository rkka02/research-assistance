# Anomaly Classifier Utility

## Purpose
Provide systematic classification of detected anomalies in physics research to distinguish between experimental artifacts, known systematic effects, and potentially significant discoveries.

## Classification Process

### Step 1: Anomaly Characterization

**For each detected anomaly:**
1. **Statistical Characterization**
   - Calculate anomaly magnitude relative to baseline
   - Assess statistical significance using appropriate tests
   - Evaluate consistency across multiple measurements
   - Determine temporal and spatial characteristics

2. **Physics Context Assessment**
   - Evaluate against known physics principles and laws
   - Check for conservation law violations or symmetry breaking
   - Assess scale and energy regime compatibility
   - Compare with theoretical predictions and expectations

### Step 2: Anomaly Type Classification

**Classification Categories:**

**Type A - Experimental Artifacts**
- Equipment malfunction or miscalibration
- Environmental interference or disturbance
- Data acquisition errors or processing mistakes
- Systematic experimental biases

**Type B - Known Systematic Effects**
- Well-characterized systematic uncertainties
- Predictable environmental variations
- Known instrumental limitations
- Documented measurement systematics

**Type C - Edge Cases of Known Physics**
- Rare but predicted phenomena
- Extreme parameter regime behavior
- Multi-body or many-particle effects
- Quantum mechanical or relativistic corrections

**Type D - Potential New Physics**
- Violations of established physical laws
- Unexplained systematic deviations
- Novel parameter dependencies
- Reproducible unexpected behaviors

### Step 3: Significance Assessment

**Significance Scoring Framework:**
1. **Statistical Significance** (25% weight)
   - p-values and confidence intervals
   - Effect size and magnitude assessment
   - Reproducibility across measurements
   - Consistency with error expectations

2. **Physics Plausibility** (25% weight)
   - Compatibility with fundamental principles
   - Energy scale and dimensional analysis
   - Theoretical framework consistency
   - Historical precedent consideration

3. **Experimental Quality** (25% weight)
   - Measurement precision and accuracy
   - Systematic error control
   - Calibration and validation quality
   - Environmental stability

4. **Discovery Potential** (25% weight)
   - Novelty and unexpectedness
   - Broader implications if confirmed
   - Research community interest level
   - Future investigation feasibility

### Step 4: Investigation Priority Determination

**Priority Levels:**

**High Priority (Score 80-100):**
- Strong statistical significance with physics plausibility
- High-quality experimental conditions
- Potential for significant physics discoveries
- Clear pathway for further investigation

**Medium Priority (Score 60-79):**
- Moderate statistical significance or experimental quality
- Some physics plausibility concerns
- Interesting but not groundbreaking potential
- Investigation feasible with additional resources

**Low Priority (Score 40-59):**
- Weak statistical evidence or poor experimental conditions
- Low physics plausibility
- Limited discovery potential
- Investigation requiring substantial resources

**Archive (Score <40):**
- Likely experimental artifacts or known effects
- Poor statistical or experimental quality
- No significant physics implications
- Not suitable for further investigation

## Classification Guidelines

### Statistical Assessment Tips

**Significance Evaluation:**

- Evaluate systematic uncertainty contributions
- Consider environmental and instrumental factors
- Assess calibration and reference standard quality

### Common Classification Errors

**Over-interpretation Patterns:**
- Assigning significance to statistical fluctuations
- Ignoring known systematic effects
- Underestimating experimental uncertainties
- Overestimating theoretical implications

**Under-interpretation Patterns:**
- Dismissing genuine anomalies as artifacts
- Overemphasizing systematic uncertainty
- Ignoring reproducible unexpected behaviors
- Undervaluing edge cases of known physics
