## Universal Presentation Principles

### 1. The STAR Structure
**Framework**: Situation → Task → Action → Result

#### Physics Application:
- **Situation**: Physical phenomenon or research context
- **Task**: Scientific question or engineering challenge  
- **Action**: Experimental approach or theoretical analysis
- **Result**: Findings, implications, and future directions

#### Template Benefits:
- Clear narrative flow maintaining audience engagement
- Logical progression from motivation to conclusion
- Emphasis on methodology and evidence
- Actionable outcomes and next steps

---

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Architecture
**Principle**: Layer information complexity based on audience needs

#### Information Hierarchy:
1. **Executive Summary** (30 seconds): Key finding in one sentence
2. **Conceptual Overview** (2-3 minutes): High-level explanation with analogies
3. **Technical Summary** (5-10 minutes): Methods and results for experts
4. **Detailed Analysis** (15-30 minutes): Complete technical documentation
5. **Supporting Materials** (as needed): Raw data, calculations, references
