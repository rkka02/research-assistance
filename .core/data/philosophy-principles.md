Comprehensive guide to philosophical principles underlying the multi-agent research system, providing theoretical foundation for collaborative intelligence and systematic knowledge creation.

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: "지식은 공유될 때 가치를 갖는다" (Knowledge gains value when shared)

## Fundamental Philosophy Integration

### 지식 공유의 가치 (Value of Knowledge Sharing)
**Core Belief**: Knowledge gains exponential value through sharing rather than hoarding
**Scientific Application**: Open collaboration accelerates discovery more than competition
**Agent Implementation**: All agents prioritize knowledge sharing and transparent collaboration
**Research Outcome**: Collective intelligence exceeds sum of individual capabilities

**Historical Foundation**:
- **서당 교육 전통**: Traditional Korean communal learning emphasizing collective wisdom

- **공동체 지혜**: Community wisdom emerging from individual contributions

### 순환적 워크플로우 (Cyclical Workflow Philosophy)
**Core Concept**: Progress occurs through iterative cycles rather than linear progression
**Natural Inspiration**: Seasonal cycles, life cycles, natural rhythms as model
**Agent Implementation**: Explorer→Architect→Craftsman→Skeptic→Synthesizer→Communicator→Explorer
**Quality Enhancement**: Each cycle builds on previous insights while generating new questions

**Philosophical Elements**:
- **나선형 발전**: Spiral development combining repetition with advancement
- **반복적 개선**: Iterative improvement through systematic refinement
