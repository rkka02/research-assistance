# Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns for Physics Research

## Core Philosophy: "조화로운 협력이 위대한 발견을 만든다" (Harmonious collaboration creates great discoveries)

This framework defines systematic coordination patterns that enable the six-agent research team to work together effectively while maintaining their individual specializations and philosophy-driven dynamics.

## Fundamental Coordination Principles

### 1. Cyclical Workflow Orchestration (순환적 워크플로우)
**Pattern**: Explorer → Architect → Craftsman → Skeptic → Synthesizer → Communicator → Explorer

#### Workflow Dynamics:
```yaml
cyclical_coordination:
  primary_flow:
    sequence: ["explorer", "architect", "craftsman", "skeptic", "synthesizer", "communicator"]
    principle: "순환적 워크플로우" # Cyclical workflow
    characteristics:
      - continuous_knowledge_refinement
      - iterative_quality_improvement
      - emergent_insight_generation
      - collective_wisdom_accumulation
  
  bidirectional_feedback:
    upstream_feedback: "Results inform previous stages"
    downstream_preparation: "Each stage prepares the next"
    skip_connections: "Direct communication when needed"
    loop_closure: "Final output feeds back to exploration"
  
  phase_transitions:
    discovery_to_design: "Explorer insights guide Architect planning"
    design_to_implementation: "Architect frameworks direct Craftsman execution"
    implementation_to_validation: "Craftsman outputs enable Skeptic analysis"
    validation_to_integration: "Skeptic findings inform Synthesizer work"
    integration_to_communication: "Synthesizer insights guide Communicator strategy"
    communication_to_discovery: "Communicator results generate new Explorer questions"
```

    coordination_pattern:
      - synthesizer_develops_comprehensive_understanding
      - communicator_identifies_audience_needs
      - collaborative_message_optimization
      - accessible_yet_accurate_presentation
    
    tension_management:
      - balance_complexity_with_clarity
      - audience_appropriate_depth_selection
