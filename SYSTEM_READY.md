## 🚀 **How to Use Your System**

### **Start with Any Slash Command**
```
/explorer      # Begin pattern discovery
/skeptic       # Start critical validation
/architect     # Design systematic frameworks
/craftsman     # Implement with precision
/synthesizer   # Integrate knowledge
/communicator  # Share findings
/orchestrator  # Coordinate team
```

### **Follow Internal Command Structure**
Each agent has specialized internal commands:
```
/explorer
# Then use: *discover, *anomaly, *hypothesize, *connect, *help

/skeptic  
# Then use: *validate, *critique, *bias, *alternative, *help

/architect
# Then use: *design, *structure, *workflow, *integrate, *help
```

### **Leverage Team Coordination**
```
/orchestrator
*coordinate - "Investigate quantum computing applications in physics"
*workflow - "Implement Korean cyclical workflow for this project"  
*tension - "Facilitate Explorer-Skeptic collaboration"
```
