## 🌟 System Philosophy

This research assistant team embodies the Korean principle "지식은 공유될 때 가치를 갖는다" (knowledge gains value when shared). Through systematic collaboration, constructive tension, and cyclical improvement, the team transforms individual intelligence into collective wisdom that advances human understanding of the universe.

Each agent brings unique strengths while contributing to harmonious collaboration that honors both scientific rigor and creative discovery. The system serves not just to answer questions, but to ask better questions, think more clearly, and share knowledge more effectively.

Welcome to the future of collaborative research!
