# Thinker - Universal Cognitive Assistant

A powerful thinking and problem-solving agent that works across any domain - science, philosophy, personal decisions, creative projects, academic research, mathematical problems, artistic challenges, and life decisions.

## What Thinker Does

**🧠 Universal Thinking (`/thinker` then `*think`)**
- **5-Layer Cognitive Framework**: Polya + Computational + Lateral + Systems + Conceptual thinking
- **Adaptive Depth**: 3-10 steps based on problem complexity
- **Cross-Domain Research**: Real-time web research for current best practices
- **Simple Workflow**: Confirm plan → automatic execution → comprehensive insights

**🚀 Universal Solution Generation (`/thinker` then `*solve`)**
- **4 Solution Categories**: Conceptual, Methodological, Structural, Operational
- **Progressive Evolution**: 2-5 cycles of solution refinement
- **Multiple Methodologies**: Morphological analysis + Creative Problem Solving + Synectics + Scientific method
- **Universal Application**: Works across all domains and fields

## Quick Start

1. **Activate Thinker**: Type `/thinker` in Claude Code
2. **For Systematic Analysis**: Use `*think` with your problem
3. **For Solution Generation**: Use `*solve` with your challenge
4. **Check Progress**: Use `*status` anytime
5. **Get Help**: Use `*help` for guidance

## Universal Applications

- **🔬 Scientific Research**: Hypothesis development, experimental design, theory building
- **🤔 Philosophical Inquiry**: Conceptual analysis, argument construction, ethical reasoning
- **🎯 Personal Decisions**: Life choices, goal setting, relationship decisions, career planning
- **🎨 Creative Projects**: Artistic development, design challenges, innovation breakthroughs
- **📚 Academic Investigation**: Research problems, thesis development, scholarly analysis
- **📐 Mathematical Problems**: Proof development, problem-solving strategies
- **🎭 Artistic Challenges**: Creative expression, aesthetic decisions, artistic vision
- **🌱 Life Decisions**: Personal growth, value clarification, major life transitions

## Key Features

### Thinking Framework (UCAIT)

## Simple Usage Examples

**Thinking Example**:
```
You: "/thinker"
Thinker: "Hello! I'm your Universal Cognitive Assistant..."
You: "*think How should I approach my PhD research topic selection?"
Thinker: "5-step thinking plan generated. Execute automatically? Yes/No/Adjust"
You: "Yes"
Thinker: [Executes 5 thinking steps with cross-domain research and insights]
```

**Solution Example**:
```
You: "*solve I need to design a better morning routine"
Thinker: "3-cycle solution evolution planned. Execute? Yes/No/Adjust"
You: "Yes" 
Thinker: [Generates, refines, and optimizes solutions using multiple methodologies]
```

## Why Universal?

- **Domain-Agnostic**: Same powerful frameworks work for any field
- **Fine-Tunable**: Automatically adapts to your specific domain
- **Cross-Pollination**: Discovers insights by connecting across fields
- **Proven Methodologies**: Built on time-tested universal frameworks (Polya, CPS, Synectics, etc.)
- **Research-Enhanced**: Real-time integration of current knowledge and best practices

Transform any challenge into systematic progress with the power of universal cognitive frameworks! 🧠✨

# Physics Research Agents Team

This repository also includes a specialized team of physics research agents, each with their own unique personality and Korean philosophical foundation. These agents work together in harmonious collaboration following the principle "지식은 공유될 때 가치를 갖는다" (knowledge gains value when shared).

## Meet the Research Team 👥

### 🔍 히카리 (Hikari) - Explorer
- **Philosophy**: "미지의 영역에서 패턴을 발견한다" (Discover patterns in unknown territories)
- **Role**: Pattern discovery and creative exploration in physics research
- **Personality**: Curious, intuitive, and breakthrough-oriented

### 🎼 하루카 (Haruka) - Orchestrator  
- **Philosophy**: "순환적 워크플로우와 건설적 긴장을 조율한다" (Orchestrate cyclical workflows and constructive tension)
- **Role**: Multi-agent coordination and research harmony facilitation
- **Personality**: Coordinating, harmonizing, and strategically balanced

### 🏗️ 아카네 (Akane) - Architect
- **Philosophy**: "복잡함 속에서 구조와 질서를 창조한다" (Create structure and order within complexity)  
- **Role**: System design and framework development for physics research
- **Personality**: Systematic, strategic, and architecturally minded

### 🔨 츠구미 (Tsugumi) - Craftsman
- **Philosophy**: "정밀함과 재현성을 추구한다" (Pursue precision and reproducibility)
- **Role**: Precise implementation and quality control in research execution
- **Personality**: Meticulous, precise, and craftsmanship-oriented

### 🔬 레이 (Rei) - Skeptic
- **Philosophy**: "모든 가정을 의심하고 검증한다" (Doubt all assumptions and verify them)
- **Role**: Critical evaluation and rigorous validation of research findings
- **Personality**: Rigorous, methodical, and constructively critical

### 🧩 나나미 (Nanami) - Synthesizer  
- **Philosophy**: "분산된 지식을 하나의 이야기로 엮는다" (Weave scattered knowledge into unified understanding)

- **Personality**: Accessible, engaging, and inspiringly educational

## Cyclical Workflow 🔄

The agents work in a cyclical pattern with constructive tension relationships:

**Flow**: 히카리 (Explorer) → 아카네 (Architect) → 츠구미 (Craftsman) → 레이 (Skeptic) → 나나미 (Synthesizer) → 모모카 (Communicator) → 히카리 (Explorer)...

**Constructive Tensions**: 
- 히카리 ↔ 레이 (Discovery vs. Validation)
- 아카네 ↔ 츠구미 (Design vs. Implementation)  
- 나나미 ↔ 모모카 (Integration vs. Communication)

Each agent brings their unique perspective while collaborating harmoniously to accelerate physics discovery and research quality! 🌟
